        <p>'I said you LOOKED like an egg, Sir,' Alice gently explained. 'And some
            eggs are very pretty, you know' she added, hoping to turn her remark
            into a sort of a compliment.</p>

        <p>'Some people,' said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual, 'have
            no more sense than a baby!'</p>

        <p>Alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at all like
            conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to HER; in fact,
            his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and
            softly repeated to herself:--</p>

            'That last line is much too long for the poetry,' she added, almost out
            loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.

    After reading this fragment Nicola wants to build his own "Humpty Dumpty".
    As a basis he choose the spheroid (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid">Read about it</a>).
    We know the height and the width (in inches) for this spheroid.
    For the work Nikola need to know how much material is required.
</p>


<p>
    You can help with it and create a function to calculate the volume (cubic inches) and the surface area (square inches).
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only" title="spheroid" src="{{MEDIA}}spheroid.png" alt="spheroid" width="600px"/>
    <img class="for_editor_only" title="spheroid" src="{{MEDIA}}spheroid.png" alt="spheroid" width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A height and a width, integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The volume and the surface area as a list of floats. The results should be accurate to two decimal.
