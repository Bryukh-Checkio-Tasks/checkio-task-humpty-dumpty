    After reading this fragment Nicola wants to build his own "Humpty Dumpty".
    As a basis he chooses the spheroid (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid">read more about it on Wikipedia</a>).
    We know the height and the width (in inches) for this spheroid. For the job at hand, Nikola needs to know how much material is required.
</p>


<p>
    You can help him and create a function to calculate the volume (cubic inches) and the surface area (square
    inches).

    <img class="for_editor_only" title="spheroid" src="{{MEDIA}}spheroid.png" alt="spheroid" width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A height and a width, integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The volume and the surface area as a list of floats. The results should be accurate to two
    decimals.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>

    <p>
        This is a simple math task, but we want to introduce you to the splendid shape --
        spheroid (in case you hadn't heard of it yet).</p>

    <p>

        The prolate spheroid is the shape of the ball in several sports, such as in rugby union, rugby league, and
        Australian football.
        In American football and Canadian football, a more pointed prolate spheroid is used.
        Several moons of the Solar system approximate prolate spheroids in shape, though they are actually scalene.
        Examples are Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys (satellites of Saturn) and Miranda (a satellite of Uranus).
        In contrast to being distorted into oblate spheroids via rapid rotation,
        celestial objects distort slightly into prolate spheroids via tidal forces when they orbit a massive body in a
        close orbit.
        The most extreme example is Jupiter's moon Io, which becomes more or less prolate in its orbit due to a
        slight eccentricity,
        causing spectacular volcanism.
        It should be noted that the major axis of the prolate spheroid does not run through the satellite's poles in
        this case,
        but through the two points on its equator directly facing toward and away from the primary.
    </p>

    <p>
        The true shape of the Earth is called an Oblate Spheroid, though it is only very slightly oblate.
        The diameter from the North Pole to the South Pole (the shortest diameter) is approximately 12,714 km.
        The equatorial diameter (the longest diameter) is approximately 12,756 km.
        This is not a big difference, but it does make the Earth not quite a sphere.
